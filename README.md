# 1️⃣ High-Level Architecture

## 🧩 System Components

### 🔹 Shopify Layer

* Admin API (products, webhooks)
* OAuth authentication
* Theme App Extension (storefront integration)

---

### 🔹 Core Application

#### A. Remix Server

* Handles OAuth flow
* Provides Admin UI (filters, sorting)
* Exposes APIs for storefront

#### B. Worker System

* Processes background jobs:

  * Product sync
  * AI API calls
  * Cache generation

#### C. Data Layer

* PostgreSQL → primary database
* Redis → caching + queue system

---

### 🔹 External AI APIs

* Used only for:

  * Recommendations
  * Search intent parsing
* App acts as a **consumer only**

---

### 🔹 Storefront Layer

* Theme App Extension renders:

  * Recommendations
  * Search results
  * Filters UI
  * Sorting UI

---

# 2️⃣ Merchant Onboarding Flow

## 🧠 Overview

Merchants are guided through a structured onboarding process to configure the app before going live.

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Welcome Screen

```
🎉 Welcome to AI Search & Recommendation

Let’s set up your store in 3 steps:
[1] Sync Products
[2] Configure Filters & Sorting
[3] Enable Storefront
```

CTA: **Start Setup**

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Product Sync

```
📦 Sync Your Products

We will import your products to power search & recommendations.

[ Start Sync ]
```

Backend Flow:

```
Shopify API → Queue → Worker → Database
```

Progress:

```
✔ 1200 / 5000 products synced
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Filter Configuration

```
- Tags (color, size)
- Price
- Vendor
```

UI:

```
🎯 Create Your Filters

Recommended:
[✔] Color
[✔] Size
[✔] Price
```

Merchant can:

* Select data source (tags / metafields / variants)
* Enable / disable filters

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Sorting Configuration

```
🔃 Sorting Options

[ Price Low → High ]
[ Price High → Low ]
[ Newest ]
[ Popularity ]
```

* Drag & drop order
* Enable / disable options

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Storefront Integration

```
🎨 Add App to Your Store

[ Customize Theme ]
```

* Opens Shopify theme editor
* Add blocks:

  * Filters
  * Search
  * Recommendations

---

### 🔹 Step 6: AI Feature Toggle

[✔] Recommendations
[✔] Intent Search
```

---

### 🔹 Step 7: Dashboard

```
📈 Performance

Searches: 1,245
Recommendation Clicks: 320
Conversion Boost: +12%
```

Sections:

* Filters Manager
* Sorting Manager

# 3️⃣ Technical Philosophy & Rules

## ⚡ Rule 1: API-First Architecture

All logic must be exposed via APIs.
Frontend should never access DB directly.

---

## ⚡ Rule 2: Async Over Sync

Avoid blocking operations:

* AI calls
* Product sync

Use queues and background workers.

---

## ⚡ Rule 3: Aggressive Caching

Cache:

* AI responses
* Search results
* Recommendations
* Filter configurations

---

## ⚡ Rule 4: Idempotency

All operations must be safe to repeat:

* Webhooks
* Jobs

---

## ⚡ Rule 5: Anonymous-First Tracking

Do not depend on login:

* Use session IDs (cookies/localStorage)

---

## ⚡ Rule 6: Graceful Failure

If AI fails:

* Return fallback results
* Never break UI

---

# 4️⃣ Core Feature: Filters & Sorting Engine

## 🧠 Overview

This app includes a **Dynamic Filter & Sorting System** fully controlled by the merchant via the admin panel.

This system has 3 layers:

1. Admin Configuration
2. Backend Query Engine
3. Storefront Dynamic UI

---

## 🔹 Admin-Defined Filters

Merchants can create filters based on:

* Color
* Size
* Material
* Brand
* Price range
* Custom metafields

---

### 📊 Example Config

```json
{
  "name": "Color",
  "field": "tags",
  "type": "multi-select",
  "ui": "checkbox",
  "values": ["red", "blue", "black"]
}
```

---

## 🔹 Backend Filter Engine

Converts user input → database query

Example:

User selects:

* Color = red
* Price < 2000

Query:

```sql
WHERE tags CONTAINS 'red'
AND price < 2000
```

---

## 🔹 Sorting Engine

Admins can define sorting strategies:

* Price (low → high, high → low)
* Newest
* Popularity (based on events)
* Custom ranking (future scope)

---

### 🔄 Sorting Flow

```
Filtered Results → Apply Sorting → Return Final Results
```

---

## 🎨 Dynamic Storefront UI

Filters and sorting are **NOT hardcoded**.

---

### 🔄 UI Flow

1. Theme extension loads container
2. Fetch filter config from API
3. Render UI dynamically
4. Apply filters → call search API

---

### 🔌 Example API

```
GET /api/filters
GET /api/sorting
POST /api/search
```

---

### 🧠 Key Principle

> UI is generated dynamically from backend config

---

## 🔄 End-to-End Flow

```
Admin creates filters → Stored in DB
        ↓
Storefront fetches config → renders UI
        ↓
User selects filters → API request
        ↓
Backend builds query → applies sorting
        ↓
Results returned → UI updates
```

---

## 🗄️ Database Additions

### 📊 Filters Table

```
id
store_id
name
field
type
ui_type
values (JSON)
position
is_active
```

---

### 📊 Sorting Table

```
id
store_id
name
label
field
order
position
is_active
```

---

# 5️⃣ Personalization Strategy

## 🧠 Overview

The system supports **hybrid personalization**:

* User-based (logged-in users)
* Session-based (guest users)
* General fallback (cold start)

---

## 🔹 User-Based Personalization (Logged-in)

* Uses Shopify customer ID
* Tracks behavior across sessions
* Can be extended with order history

---

## 🔹 Session-Based Personalization (Guest)

* Uses anonymous session ID
* Tracks short-term behavior

---

## 🔹 General Recommendation (Fallback)

* Trending products
* Best sellers
* New arrivals

---

## 🔄 Decision Logic

```
IF customer_id exists:
    → User-based personalization
ELSE IF session has data:
    → Session-based personalization
ELSE:
    → General recommendations
```

---

## 🔄 Session Merge Strategy

When a user logs in:

```
Session data → Attach to customer profile
```

---

## 🗄️ Database Additions

### 📊 Customers Table

```

store_id
shopify_customer_id

### 📊 Events Table
